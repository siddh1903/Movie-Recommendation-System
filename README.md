Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on content similarity. Using various features such as genre, keywords, cast, and crew, this model provides personalized movie recommendations based on content-based filtering techniques.

Project Overview
The system builds a recommendation engine by creating tags from multiple attributes to capture the essence of each movie. These tags are then vectorized to calculate similarities and recommend movies with similar characteristics.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: The model uses content-based filtering techniques by analyzing movie metadata, including:

Genres: Categorical data capturing movie themes.
Keywords: Key descriptors of the movie.
Cast and Crew: Identifies key actors, directors, and other personnel.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Stemming: Reduces words to their root forms, enabling more generalized matching.
Vectorization: Uses a text vectorizer to convert tags into numerical format for similarity calculations.

Similarity Calculation:

Cosine Similarity: Computes similarities between movies based on vectorized tags, which allows for effective content-based recommendations.

Libraries Used
Pandas and NumPy: For data handling and processing.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): For vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
NLTK: Used for stemming and text preprocessing.
Matplotlib (optional): To visualize similarity metrics and performance.

Getting Started

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system

Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook: Open and run movie_recommender_system.ipynb to build the recommendation system and test with example inputs.

Usage
To use the system, provide a movie title, and the model will output a list of movies with similar content characteristics based on cosine similarity.

Results
The recommendation system offers relevant movie suggestions based on shared attributes. For additional details on performance and metrics, see the output sections in the notebook.
